## Changes Since Previous Deliverable

In this milestone, the main features that have been introduced to the game are the solver, hint system, and the move
undo/redo.

The solver component will provide the user with in-game hints to help them progress through the game. The solver uses a
breadth-first search algorithm to traverse through all the possible moves within a given board to determine the
solution (if there is one). The solver can provide all the steps required to pass the level which is then cached. The
winning path is cached so the path would only be recalculated when the user moves to a path that differs from the
winning path. The solver component will improve the gameplay for the user since they will be able to progress through
the game when they get stuck.

The levels are loaded using a JSON file that contains an array of levels, which are represented as strings. The string
representation of the level is then used to produce a board object for the user to play. This will allow for easier
modification for levels and level expansions. During this process, the project was converted to Maven to allow the use
of helpful external libraries (namely ones that can parse JSON and perform logging).

The undo and redo functionalities use two stacks to keep track of all the moves made. They are then used to make moves
on the board based on the user's choice. The focus of these functions is to allow the user to explore different paths
with the pieces in the puzzle. This will prevent the user from having to reset the game every time they want to try a
different path.

A document containing a user manual and design decisions has also been provided to allow the user to understand the
workings of the game and the reasoning behind the design choices that were made to implement the solver, JSON level
representation, and the undo/redo functionality.

## Known Issues

- There are currently no known issues with the deliverables for milestone 3.

## Roadmap Ahead

For the next and final milestone (milestone 4), a level builder that creates levels in a JSON format so that the user
can save and load will have to be delivered. The solver will then be used to validate the level the user has created (
i.e. that the level is actually solvable and not already in a winning state).
