## Changes Since Previous Deliverable

In this milestone, the main feature that has been introduced to the game is the GUI component. The GUI component will
enhance the user experience during gameplay. The game now features a board image that shows the user all the game pieces
placed on the board. In this milestone, Unit testing has also been introduced. Unit testing is used to test the model
component of the game to ensure the game runs smoothly.

The code for the game is designed using the MVC design pattern. During milestone 1 the model component was completed and
submitted. In this milestone, the view and controller have also been added. There have also been some modifications to
the model based on the TA's suggestions. The modifications made will ensure that delegation, encapsulation, and cohesion
are fully used throughout the code. Based on the code review held during the weekly meeting we have also discussed
improvements on existing code. These improvements are made to remove code redundancy, duplication and code smell. This
will improve the software overall.

The major change in the UML class diagram from milestone 1 is that all text-based command processing has been removed,
as that aspect of the game is no longer needed for any purpose. Board and Piece-inheriting classes no longer need to
represent themselves as strings, and as such methods related to this have been removed. The major addition to the class
diagram in this milestone is the classes representing the view and controller potions of the game, as the GUI portion of
the game must be delivered for this milestone.

A document containing a user manual and design decisions has also been provided to allow the user to understand the
workings of the game and the reasoning behind the design choices that were made to implement this GUI-based version of
the game.

## Known Issues

- There are currently no known issues with the deliverables for milestone 2.

## Roadmap Ahead

For the next milestone (milestone 3), a solver that uses either depth-first or breadth-first search to solve a puzzle
will have to be implemented. This solver will have to be integrated into the GUI in terms of hints that can be given to
the user. Also, undo/redo features will have to be provided to the user, allowing them to backtrack as far back as
necessary. We will also have to provide unit tests for any new classes. In addition to this, we will have to pay close
attention to and keep track of any changes we make to the UML delivered in this milestone and explain the reasons as to
why those changes were implemented. As we progress through the next milestone, we will also implement the feedback given
to us concerning this deliverable by the TA who is assigned to our group.
